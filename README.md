# FARSIGHT
FARSIGHTs are aptamer-based sensors that enable rapid detection of nucleic acid point mutations. For more information on these systems, please read the preprint ["Programmable Fluorescent Aptamer-Based RNA Switches for Rapid Identification of Point Mutations" by Z. Yan et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.07.25323576v1).

# Requirements
Like the [SNIPR design code](https://github.com/Albert09111/SNIPR/tree/master), the FARSIGHT design code uses Matlab and the multi-objective nucleic acid design and energy calculation functions of NUPACK. Users must download the [NUPACK source code](http://www.nupack.org/downloads) and compile it on their computers. Please follow the NUPACK manual to install NUPACK. 

After installation, it is necessary to add NUPACK to the systemâ€™s environmental variables to ensure that it can be located by the FARSIGHT code. 

From a terminal window, open or create a .bash_profile file in your home directory with the command:

`open ~/.bash_profile`

This file will be run whenever a bash shell is opened and can be used to set environment variables. In the resulting text editor environment, add the NUPACK directory as the following example.

`export NUPACKHOME=/home/Documents/nupack3.2.2`

`export PATH=$PATH":${NUPACKHOME}/bin"`

[For nano, save your changes by typing ctrl + o and hit return to save. Exit nano by typing ctrl + x.]

After setting the environment variables, Matlab will need to be opened from a terminal window to use NUPACK based functions. A sample command to open Matlab is below and will vary depending on the Matlab install directory:

`/Applications/MATLAB_R2024b.app/bin/matlab`
